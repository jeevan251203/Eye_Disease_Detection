# Eye Disease Detection Using YOLOv8

## Overview
The Eye Disease Detection System is a machine learning-based application designed to detect and classify eye diseases from medical images. Utilizing YOLOv8, the system is capable of predicting multiple classes of eye diseases with high accuracy.

## Features
- **Real-time Detection**: Provides real-time prediction of eye diseases from images.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Detects and classifies various types of eye diseases.
- **High Accuracy**: Leverages the power of YOLOv8 for precise and efficient predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for uploading images and viewing predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8**: State-of-the-art object detection model used for disease prediction.
- **Python**: Programming language for developing the model and application.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks used for training and inference.
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application interface.

## Classes
The system is capable of predicting the following classes of eye diseases:
- Diabetic Retinopathy
- Glaucoma
- Cataract
- Normal (No Disease)
